**Form settings:**
- Collect email addresses: Yes

**Share the form link** instead of asking them to email/WhatsApp the video.

**Subject: Request for Endorsement - Brother Ibrahim (islamland.com founder)**

Assalamu alaikum Sheikh/Imam [Name],

I hope this message finds you in good health and iman.

I'm reaching out regarding **Brother Ibrahim Ali Abu Al-Qasim**, founder of islamland.com. For 20 years, he has translated Islamic content into 140+ languages, serving millions of Muslims worldwide.

Brother Ibrahim now faces a medical emergency requiring surgery in Tunisia. The Ummah is gathering to support him.

**Would you be willing to record a brief (30-second) video endorsement?**

I've attached a simple guide with talking points and instructions. It takes just 2 minutes.

Your voice carries weight in our community, and your support would help Brother Ibrahim receive the care he needs.

JazakAllahu Khayran for your time and consideration.

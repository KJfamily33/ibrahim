## TL;DR - The Strategy

**Problem:** Ibrahim is in Libya. Libyan banks have liquidity crisis. He can't even access his OWN money. PayPal/Stripe/GoFundMe don't work there.

**Solution:** YOU become the bridge.
1. Set up LaunchGood campaign in YOUR name (you = organizer, Ibrahim = beneficiary)
2. Donations go to YOUR bank account
3. You pay the Tunisian hospital directly OR send via Western Union
4. Add crypto option for whales who want to give that way

## What YOU Need to Do (Human Tasks)

### Priority 1: Get These From Ibrahim (URGENT)

- [ ] **Photo of Ibrahim's ID** (passport or national ID)
- [ ] **Signed attestation letter** - A simple letter saying:
  > "I, Ibrahim Ali Abu Al-Qasim, authorize [YOUR NAME] to fundraise on my behalf for my medical treatment in Tunisia."
  > Signed, dated, photo of him holding it if possible
- [ ] **Name of the Tunisian hospital** where he'll get treatment
- [ ] **His crypto wallet address** (if he has one - TON or USDC preferred)
  - If he doesn't have one, we can help him set up a Telegram Wallet (uses TON)

### Priority 2: Set Up LaunchGood Campaign

1. Go to https://www.launchgood.com/start
2. Create campaign as **"Fundraising for someone else"**
3. Fill in:
   - Campaign title: "Help Ibrahim - The Pilgrim Falcon's Journey to Healing"
   - Goal: €20,000 (or whatever the actual medical cost is)
   - Your bank info for payouts
   - Ibrahim's info as beneficiary
4. Upload Ibrahim's ID and attestation letter when prompted
5. Get the embed code once approved

### Priority 3: Domain Setup

- [ ] Point **ibrahim.help** domain to the Vercel deployment
  - Current live URL: https://ibrahim-falcon.vercel.app
  - Go to your domain registrar, add CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
  - Or add in Vercel dashboard under project settings → Domains

### Priority 4: Crypto Setup (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Get Ibrahim's TON wallet address (he can use @wallet in Telegram)
- [ ] Get/create a USDC address on Base network
- [ ] I'll add these to the website donation section

### Priority 5: Scholar & Imam Endorsements (HIGH IMPACT)

Religious endorsement carries major weight. Ibrahim's 20 years of Islamic work means he has connections.

**Ask Ibrahim for:**
- [ ] Names of scholars he's worked with or who used islamland.com
- [ ] Any existing relationships with Islamic organizations
- [ ] Permission to reach out on his behalf

**Types of endorsement to request:**
- [ ] 30-second video testimonial ("I know Brother Ibrahim's work...")
- [ ] Written quote for the website
- [ ] Share campaign with congregation/followers
- [ ] Mention in Jummah khutbah dua

**High-reach scholars to consider:**
- Mufti Menk (huge social following)
- Omar Suleiman (Yaqeen Institute)
- Yasir Qadhi
- Local imams in major Muslim cities

**Islamic organizations:**
- ISNA, ICNA (North America)
- MCB (UK)
- Islamic Relief leadership
- Penny Appeal (potential fiscal sponsor AND endorser)

**Approach with adab:**
- Have Ibrahim make introduction if possible
- Ask for dua first, endorsement second
- Be clear this is a medical emergency, not ongoing fundraising

## Why This Works

1. **LaunchGood** - Muslim crowdfunding platform, handles payment processing, tax receipts
2. **You as intermediary** - Your bank works, Libya's doesn't
3. **Direct hospital payment** - Cleanest option, 100% transparent
4. **Western Union** - Just reactivated in Libya (Dec 2025), Ibrahim can pick up cash
5. **Crypto** - No banks needed at all, instant, global

---

## Context You Might Forget

- The website has a "Pilgrim Falcon" theme based on Rumi's poetry
- "Falco peregrinus" = peregrine falcon = Latin for "pilgrim falcon"
- Ibrahim ran islamland.com for 20 years, translating Islamic content into 140+ languages
- The falcon symbolism: he soared across the Ummah carrying Allah's message, now the Ummah must carry him
- Site is bilingual (Arabic/English)

## When You Wake Up

1. Read this file
2. Message Ibrahim to get the documents listed above
3. Start the LaunchGood campaign setup
4. Come back here and tell Claude what you need help with

**Rest well. Ibrahim's journey continues tomorrow. InshaAllah.**
